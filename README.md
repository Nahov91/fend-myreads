# MyReads webapp
This is a Udacity Front end web developer ND project, where I had to make a site alive with React.js and React Router.

## Get started

### What is this?
This is a webapp where you can sort your books into different shelves based on if you have read them.

### How to get it working?
- Clone or download all the files from this repository
- In your terminal go to the folder using cd command
- Run `npm install`
- Run the server with the following command :`npm start`
- open up _localhost: 3000_ in your browser 

### More details about the webapp
When you successfully run the site you first meet the home screen. On this screen you see three shelves (Currently Reading, Want to Read, Read). You can put the books you read in this three categories with the more button on each book. You can add more books using the "plus" button on the bottom right. When you press it a search screen appears where you can type the title or the author of the book. You can add these books to your categories the same way you did on the home screen with clicking the more button on the individual books. 

## Contributing
The files in this repository are used for a Udacity Google FEND project called the *My Read*. Because of this, pull requests will not be merged into the project.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Developed with
This piece of software was developed using React, React Router, Escape RegExp and CSS Grid.
